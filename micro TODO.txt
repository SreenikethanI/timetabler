=== Some terms ===
  • Renderer = index.html
  • Builder = builder.html

=== TODO ===
  • add docstrings to all constants (@const) and functions in modules

=== DONE ===
  • builder.js > parseDays: try to parse "M34 ..." instead of "M_34 ..."
  • convert `Constants.SECTIONS` into a list for corresponding semesters (now
    renamed to `Constants.SEMESTERS`)
  • pass `sem_index` to `getTimetableFull` as well
