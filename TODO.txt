=== Some terms ===
• Renderer = index.html
• Builder = builder.html

=== TODO ===
• convert `Constants.SECTIONS` into a list for corresponding semesters
• pass `sem_index` to `getTimetableFull` as well
• merge Builder into Renderer -- first half of Renderer is a table which inputs
  sections for courses -- second half of Renderer displays/compares/etc
• add semester index selection dropdown
• create user-facing page to explain program, and a more technical markdown
  document to explain JS object structures like minimal timetable, full timetable,
  course list, etc

=== DONE ===
• builder.js > parseDays: try to parse "M34 ..." instead of "M_34 ..."
