| File | Description |
| ---: | --- |
| [comparison decision table.**xlsx**](<comparison decision table.xlsx>) | This is a table describing how two timetables shall be compared, period-for-period. For better context, check out `compareTimetables()` function in [main.js](/scripts/main.js). |
| [builder mock.**pptx**](<builder mock.pptx>) | A mock design for the builder dialog. I used this just for "brainstorming" at some point in time and probably didn't bother updating it since then. |
| [cwtt appendix hash 1.**png**](<cwtt appendix hash 1.png>) | Image for [cwtt/README.md](../coursewise%20timetables/README.md) |
